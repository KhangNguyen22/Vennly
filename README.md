An award winning party app. Achieved 1st place for Mobile Computing Course at the University of Sydney.

Start interesting conversations, learn your friends secrets with this app! 

The objective of the party app is to place prompts, such as celebrity names, into categories. As each person does this, at the end of the game, each person placement of prompts is revealed, resulting in interesting discussions. An example would be  "gorilla" (prompt) and 3 categories such as handsome, funny and stupid. Player X may put gorilla as handsome and funny only, while player Y may put gorilla as only stupid.
